          <p>Here is our second installment of insight into female behaviour. Now, I know this won't apply to every female I know, heck, not even the majority of the females I know, but it's a pretty common thing; why high-heeled shoes? Where did they come from? After much searching about on the internet, I happened upon this <a href="http://193.251.60.36/Jenny/history.htm">website</a> detailing the history of high heeled shoes. Essentially, high heeled shoes are a way for females to make up a height disadvantage, as well as forcing the muscles in the leg to be tensed, so that the calves are more shapely. As well, according to this website, the high-heeled shoe affects the psychology of women, and their attitudes in interesting ways. So, girls, do you, and why do you wear high heeled shoes?</p>

<p>PS: I don't know why I wrote this. I don't even know why I was thinking about it. No, this isn't about a specific person. And NO, I don't have foot fetish. It just happened that I was walking across the extremely icy floor of the Finch Station parking lot, and saw many women in high heeled shoes struggling not to slip, and so I was curious why they would put themselves through so much suffering. So there. =P</p>

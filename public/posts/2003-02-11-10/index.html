          <p>The new archival system is online, although it is far from perfect. I haven't figured out how to disallow clicking on a date without a comment, but I'm sure it shouldn't be too difficult. The good thing about it is that it limits the amount of entries displayed to those that were made the current week, so there is less displayed on the front page. As I was browsing about the web, I can across this <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/powerlaw_weblog.html">article</a> which analyzes the social hierarchy in weblogging, and how it follows a power law distribution (if weblogs are ranked according to inbound links). It's actually quite an interesting read, so I suggest that you check it out. But throughout the article, one question stuck out in my mind. Why read the blog of someone you don't know, or don't care about? The only reason I can think of is that they have something interesting to say, and it's like reading a good article or a book. But all these &#8220;popular&#8221; bloggers don't seem to have anything useful to say. With that in mind, I think I'll stick with reading the weblogs of the people I know, which I read to gain insight into their thoughts and feelings.</p>

          <p>ever get the feeling that just around the corner, there's something unknown, just around the corner, waiting to jump out and screw you? Well, I discovered what it was today; my psych 354 midterm, in two days. That, coupled with a (thus far) solo OS project, an untouched software spec assignment, and an evening-wasting algorithms assignment (took out three hours with nothing to show for it), makes for a very depressing academic career so far. It doesn't help that I've got people criticising almost my every move, and a room that looks like a disaster area, even after three iterations of cleaning. Regardless, there ARE in fact some high points in my life. In no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>social dance (ALWAYS a bright point)</li>
<li>a semi-successful surprise birthday party</li>
<li>a newly re-focussed cell group</li>
<li>an AWESOME CG co-lead and members</li>
<li>a <em>very</em> decorated room, thanks in no small part to a huge assortment of furnishings left by an incredible graduate (who is sorely missed)</li>
<li>a successfully cooked chicken dinner</li>
<li>Soul Caliber skills</li>
</ul>

<p>I just hope I can stay concetrated on my work, and I hope I don't have many more wasted evenings because of stupid 341. Wow, this is the verse I <em>just</em> read; I think it's a straight message to me:</p>

<p>&#8220;Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.&#8221; - Galations 6:2</p>

<p>I guess that's what I'll have to do; time for some close examination of kernel.cc</p>

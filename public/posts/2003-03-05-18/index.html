          <p><em>the reason</em><br />
There have been very few recent updates in part due to the horrible weather we've been having, in part due to some actual work at work, and in part due to my own laziness. =P However, I've managed to get in almost a full day of guitar practice on the weekend, and I can *almost* play &#8220;God of Wonders&#8221; straight through. =)<br />
Anyways, I've posted pictures of the tobogganing experience in the gallery, and I'll also talk about them here:<br />
<a href="http://www.regularxpression.com/gallery/displayPicture.aspx?path=PicturesTobogganing&amp;#038;picture=jump1.jpg"><img src="http://www.regularxpression.com/gallery/Pictures/_thumbnails/t_jump1.jpg.gif" alt="jump1" /></a><br />
After building the jump ramps with the giant pylons, and going off them a few times, we noticed that one of our friends got a surprising amount of airtime, and so we decided that he had enough airtime to do a jump over the length of a human body. So, we tried it. =) This was the first test, and you can see that he clears the marker we set up easily.</p>

The second time we did it, we noticed that he squashed the marker, although he still cleared our legs, and so we decided to stop after that, especially since I had just been run over by a GT SnoRacer. (that's me on the side closest to the camera!)</p>

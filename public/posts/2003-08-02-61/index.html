          <p>heh, you're all going to have to bear with me, as most of my next few posts will relate to school; since I am embroiled in exams right now. =p</p>

<p>As for the exam I wrote yesterday night, one word.. BLEGH! I'm glad it's over though; it's highly probable that I will never have to take that course again, or anything that relates to it in any manner. =p Thanks to this professor's marking scheme and a cheat sheet policy, it's pretty difficult to fail this course. =) For some reason, I'm remarkably unworried about my exam that is coming up in; oh; 5.5 hours? *shrug* I never did get worried about psych exams. Now Concurrency, and Statistics, those are cause for concern. =(</p>

<p>Ooooh; I picked up some DVDs from HMV while I was over at conestoga helping someone pick up a new phone; Did you know that there are almost no phone numbers for the 519 area code in london? Anyhow, the dvds were &#8220;Strictly Ballroom&#8221;, a movie about dancing (soooo cool!!!), and a Judy Garland movie, about a singer (obviously made before she lost her voice). I'm looking forward to the end of exams, so I can do all the things that I'm planning to do, like;..</p>

<ul>
<li>redesign parts of my website, and expand the features</li>
<li>digitise the logo that I designed</li>
<li>reformat my SUPER buggy computer</li>
<li>start working with VS.NET 2003</li>
<li>play some more badminton</li>
<li>read the half a billion books that I've picked up this term</li>
<li>hang out with friends more</li>
<li>Frozen Throne!</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not sure how many of these I'll get done, especially with that last item on the list; =) I can't believe the term has flown by soooo fast. Three months was like the flash of a camera. So much finished, so much left to do;.. If any of you see me lazing about on my holiday, kick me into action, so that I won't waste my time! =p Okay, time to go back to my studies; and to read more about peer groups and social development. =)</p>

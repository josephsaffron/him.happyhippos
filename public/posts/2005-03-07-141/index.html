          <p>What a busy weekend! So much packed into those two days.. Big Idea Productions did a few pre-release showings of the new Veggie Tales spectacular <a href="http://www.bigidea.com/videos/veggietales/vt024/default.htm">Duke and the Great Pie War</a>! It was well done, providing a creative new look into the stories of <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=ruth&amp;#038;version=31">Ruth</a> and <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=deuteronomy%201%3A1-2%3A10&amp;#038;version=31">Miriam</a>. Definitely a must see! Also, they gave away $3 off coupons for the dvd and also another dvd, <a href="http://bigidea.com/videos/veggietales/vt021/default.htm">An Easter Carol</a>. Probably going to pick them up at some point. After that was worship practice for this Sunday; had to lead two Sundays in three weeks! Psycho worship organisers; =/ That went well though, and it was time to get ready for Grad ball;. Except that the car broke down! Good thing that Calla had a CAA membership! (Or BCAA, bleh, stupid BC people always want their own name) Anyway, Calla came to the rescue again, providing a car to get to the ball. It was an enjoyable experience, and we get free Grad wineglasses, two per ticket. Since we found an additional two tickets, we got eight in total! People kept mentioning that we matched, but it was actually just a coincidence. Last week I was at vaughan mills looking for a red shirt, and the shirts were so cheap that I just happened to pick up a dark purple one as well. Ties were on sale for $10! Anyway, I heard em say she was going to wear a purple dress (sunglasses + shirt = purple, funny story, ask me if you're interested) so I just grabbed the purple shirt and hoped that we'd match. I guess I'll let you guys be the judge:</p>

<p>Sunday morning was worship leading, and a few;interesting; events happened during service. Joanna, this is what I called about yesterday, to tell you about.. =p But no one picked up! Anyway, during one song I came in on the wrong note; about an octave too high wrong. That hurt. heh. But the song was good. =) During the sermond, my chair broke! Apparently it's NOT because I had too much to eat that morning, but rather because the chair was already broken, and PT had spot welded it. Spot welding apparently can't hold my weight, so there was a huge *snap* in the middle of service. Siiiiigh;.</p>

<p>After service, I went to see the <a href="http://www.skatecanada.ca/en/events_results/events/jrworlds05/">2005 ISU World Junior Figure Skating Championships</a>. There were some AMAZING skaters there! Japan's fourteen year old <a href="http://www.skatecanada.ca/en/events_results/events/jrworlds05/news/story5.cfm">Mao Asada</a> landed a <em>Triple Axel</em>, one of the hardest jumps in all of figure skating! She gave an absolutely stellar performance, definitely Olympic material. I can pretty much guarantee you that we'll be seeing her in the 2010 Olympics. Another favourite was the ice dancing couple Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir. In a playful display of skating skill, they told the story of a ballerina and a regular boy, each showing the other their own style of dancing. There were so many incredible performances that I don't have room to list them all, but suffice it to say that if you enjoy watching figure skating, you should definitely catch this event the next time it occurs.</p>

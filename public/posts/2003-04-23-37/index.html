          <p>This is how I looked by the end of the day.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.student.math.uwaterloo.ca/~j34wong/today.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>I am DEAD for this weekend; after an intense easter weekend, of over 25 hours at church, I am <em>leading</em> worship team 3 this Sunday. Jon, who was supposed to lead, is now in quarantine after he had a fever (which broke, so he's okay right now, and it's probably NOT SARS), leaving me to take over with a total of TWO other worship team members, since three others are unavailiable. To make matters worse, there is now no fellowship program this friday, since Jon was supposed to lead bible study. I *do* have an alternate plan, so I'll see if that can work out. Right now I am just super tired, with a headache and whatnot. I am DEFINATELY sleeping early tonite. Add that to the stress of this being the last two weeks of work, and tuition being due, and the CPU I just bought not working; and you see what is happening. =p</p>

<p>The only bright point of today was the fact that I handed in my COMPLETED work report today. =) WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!</p>

<p>I think I'll go take a nap now; no, wait, I have to call people; argh;;.</p>

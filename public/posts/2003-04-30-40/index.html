          <p>Oh how I wish I had something to do; it's gotten to the point where I'm &#8220;saving&#8221; the time it takes to wash my dishes so that I can take up 10 minutes of my time here at work. =p On the plus side, I found a game with a VERY small screen-size footprint, so I can play it at work: <a href="http://www.liquidcode.org/worm.html" target="_blank">SFCave!</a> My high score has only been 2214, so if anyone can beat that, let me know! =) Also, I've got a web-based tradewars 2002 (which is a LOT of fun, and much easier to use than the original, since you can automatically set up trade routes!) called <a href="http://bnt1.blacknova.net/" target="_blank">BlackNova</a>. Try them, if you're as bored as me. =) This weekend is going to be PACKED. From Friday to Sunday, morning, afternoon, and night are completely full! I'm even considering moving in early Sunday morning to waterloo and catching morning service at KWCAC. Now that would be fun; I also have to give my sis a tour of my school, especially since it is now her FIRST choice.. yay! Ditch evil McMaster, and their rip-off meal plan! ; ) However, Waterloo is cheap, as usual, and gave her no scholarship, even though other schools gave her over $14,000 (in total). =( Oh well, there're always bursaries. And I'm applying for osap, too. =)</p>

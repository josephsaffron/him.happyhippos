          <p>A gorgeous day outside, ice cream in my hand, and friends to walk with. =) What more could I ask for? Well, aside from a copy of my midterm tonite. =)</p>

<p>Other than that though, I've never been more happy. This term has just been incredible so far, with so much to do, and so much more time to do it. I think that I've learned a lot this term, and I'm not talking about school. I've rediscovered the power of prayer, and how willing God is to listen to our requests, drawing people nearer to Him in the process. I've learned how important it is to stay true to your commitments, and to follow through with what you promise. I've learned how it feels to earnestly seek after something, and how to respond when it is denied. I've learned the importance of solitude, and spending time alone with God to think. And most importantly, I've learned that people care. They notice things, and they see when things are wrong. Friends who pray for you without your asking, and who are concerned about your well being. I am so blessed this term, by so many things, and I thank God so much for all that He has given to me.</p>

          <p>I think spring has come a little earlier this year, with our balmy weather and heavy rains; and a few newly blossoming relationships. Now, typically relationships don't start in the middle of winter when it's freezing cold, but the wave of warm weather has possibly given a little nudge to a few budding relationships. =)</p>

<p>I guess I was partially inspired by the rash of relationship articles on <a href="http://boundless.org">Boundless</a> and just a general curiosity inspired by the relationships talk at my <a href="http://ntcbc.org">Church's</a> summer conference to read this book:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0736902805/sr=8-2/qid=1140195921/ref=sr_1_2/002-1760656-6346451?%5Fencoding=UTF8"><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0736902805.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>It's quite a good book, explaining the differences between the way men and women think in a way that is both informative and humourous. Its light tone and captivating anecdotes go a long way towards increasing the book's readability. Also useful is the appendix, which has devotions and discussions for both small groups and for dating couples to use to learn more about each other and themselves. This book has the most understandable and reasonable theories about the way relationships that I've ever read. It's also interesting because it has a few date suggestions that any dating couple can go on to get to know each other in a meaningful way. This stands in sharp contrast to the dates of today, where a girlfriend and boyfriend sit adjacent to each other in comfortable chairs, staring straight ahead at a flashing screen (read, movie dates). Rather, they suggest doing things like Habitat for Humanity, or working in a soup kitchen, or volunteering to look after kids together, activities that allow you to see how a person reacts in real environments, how they deal with conflicts, and how well they work together with you towards a common goal. This is especially important in light of the fact that they will eventually be working toward the common goal of raising a godly family.</p>

<p>I really got a lot out of this book, and sometimes find myself referring to it as a guide or translation manual. =) It's good because it's written by a couple together, so you get perspectives from both sides. Anyway, I recommend this book toanyone who's interested in relationships (who isn't?), and hopefully you'll learn something!</p>

<p>by the way, congratulations to two of my good friends.. =)</p>

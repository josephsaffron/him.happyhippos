          <p>I would've liked to say that my first experience snowboarding was overwhelming fun, with me sliding smoothly to the bottom of the mountain (just like SSX3!) as pictured below:</p>

<p>However, it was not to be. Not that it wasn't immensely fun, but my experience looked more like this:</p>

<p>Yes indeed. I must have fallen at least sixty times, with twenty-five of those times in the first run down. I spent the majority of my time on mt rear end, and needless to say, my post snowboarding pain was very great. I've figured out how to &#8220;carve&#8221; down the mountain, though, and stopping is not a problem (at least, forward stopping). I had a LOT of fun, and it only cost about $25 for the whole day lift pass! Since I have all the equipment availiable to me, I didn't have anything to rent, so it was just food and lift costs. Well, if you count monetary costs alone, it was cheap. The cost to my body was very high. =p I am feeling so pained that merely walking is an excercise in tolerance. I have quite a massive bruise on my right knee, about the size of the knee, but shifted over slightly. Sitting down is nerve-wracking, and picking things up has become quite a chore. However, I would not hesitate to go again! (as soon as I've recovered;) Ask me anytime if you want to go! =) I'll say yes at least 90% of the time!</p>

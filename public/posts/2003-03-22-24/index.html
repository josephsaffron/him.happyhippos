<p>Hi there..ResNet is free to all residence students. Where you got 75 from is</p>

<p>confusing to me. I must warn you . We are very strict when it comes to</p>

<p>bandwidth usage and downloading of copyrighted material. If your cought you</p>

<p>will be disconnected. So if you need to use up loads of bandwidth were</p>

<p>telling students to get rogers. Cause here you only get 500 meg a week.</p>

<p>Should you go over that limit your will be constrained and when your in</p>

<p>constrained mode its almost impossible to get your assignments online. So</p>

<p>use your bandwidth wisely. Your here to learn not play games or dload</p>

<p>copyrighted material. UofW is very strict about this kind of activity..</p>

<p>Just thought you should be forewarned as I am the one who disconnects users</p>

<p>for such violations. Getting back online after breaking the rules isn,t as</p>

<p>easy as you might think depending on the reason. In some cases you can be</p>

<p>permanently disconnected for the remainder of your time here at uofw, not</p>

<p>just for the term. I suggest you read our policies and take them to heart.</p>

<p>Cause we do.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Jeff Sturm</p>

<p><strong>what did I do!?!? he gets all defensive, basically threatening me with stuff, and yah. not answering the question at all. So I remain civil (maybe he's just been indoctrinated? and give this response:</strong></p>

<p>Subject: RE: resnet port blocking?</p>

<p>From the housing webpage:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come this September, increased ResNet fees will be mandatory for all</p>

<p>students in UW residences. The residence networking fee will increase 50</p>

<p>percent from $50 to $75 for students living in Village I, Ron Eydt Village</p>

<p>(REV), William Lyon Mackenzie King Village, UW Place and Grebel and St.</p>

<p>Paul's Colleges.&#8221;</p>

<p>relevant link: <a href="http://archive.uwstudent.org/story/2218">http://archive.uwstudent.org/story/2218</a></p>

<p>The resnet fee of $75 is bundled into the cost of residence.</p>

<p>And getting back to my prior question, could you put me in touch with anyone</p>

<p>who would know exactly what the limits imposed on ports, and which ports</p>

<p>they are placed on?</p>

<p>Thanks for any help you can offer.</p>

<p>Hi there..Sorry but we will not give out that kind of info..If we did then</p>

<p>this would give all students the power to aim there programs threw unblocked</p>

<p>ports. So in essence no I don,t have a list of ports and no I donot know who</p>

<p>would give them to you anyhow..So sorry ..I can,t help you on this issue. No</p>

<p>one here ever asks about that unless there planning on going around blocked</p>

<p>ports.</p>

<p>Jeff Sturm</p>

<p>ResNet.</p>

<p>So, basically I am not allowed to know what ports are slow, and not only that, I am accused (implicitly, but the accusation is there) of attempting to &#8220;cheat&#8221; UW, by going around port restrictions that <em>aren't even declared!</em> Nowhere on any IST or resnet website does it say that there are restricted ports, and they present ResNet as a competitor/alternative to other internet providers, which DO clearly state their policies. It is unacceptable for UW to behave in such a restrictive and unilateral manner, forcing a resNet connection, and then restricting it, secretly. I should have a right to know what I am paying for! Grr;. I'm going to take this as far up as I can go.</p>

          <p>Even in an enormous campus like the University of illinois, the effect of twenty thousand Christians was immediately apparent. No matter where you looked, there were people praying, preaching, and reading bibles. Morning hours were filled with people praying and doing devotions, anxiously awaiting word from their God. Forgetting was impossible, as reminders were all around. Prayers were common, and praises even more so. Hallways would echo with personal songs sung directly to God. When we were gathered together, we were as a giant body of believers, and it crossed my mind that <em>this</em> was what God originally intended. This was what we were striving for, that all the world would worship God together, and in one voice, every knee bowing and every tongue confessing that Jesus Christ is Lord.</p>

<p>&#8220;After this I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. And they cried out in a loud voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Salvation belongs to our God,</p>

<p>who sits on the throne,</p>

<p>and to the Lamb.&#8221;</p>

<p>-Revelation 7:9-10</p>

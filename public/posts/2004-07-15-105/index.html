          <p>So a few days ago, I'm over at SLC giving blood for my second time. As the nurse is trying to draw blood, I'm talking to my friend, and all of a sudden I stop talking. My friend asks me what's wrong, and I answer that I am extreme pain; the nurse is pulling and pushing the needle back and forth, and she does this five or six times trying to find a vein! They eventually give up, and try my other (right) arm, which bleeds a lot better since it's my dominant arm. Anyway, my left arm's been hurting for awhile now, especially since I was doign construction work as well as dancing today, aggravating the pain. ooooh, yeah, I can talk about Habitat for Humanity, which I've been helping out with! Basically, it's an organisation which builds affordable housing for responsible families that can't afford housing. Without further ado;</p>

<p><strong>day one</strong></p>

<p>We went as a group, seven people, along with the sybase people. It was a gorgeous day, with sunshine and everything! Dave Tse, Mike, Grace and I were working on the roof doing vinyl siding. There is a crazy amount of prep work that goes into doing siding. All day long we were putting J-trim around the windows and top, and starter-strip along the bottom. Finally, we got to put one <em>single</em> piece of siding on! You can see it in the picture:</p>

<p>See that single piece of siding along the bottom? That was the fruits of our labour; haha. Anyway, the experience was really enjoyable, with good food and plenty of learning experiences. I got over my fear of heights that day! =) (see photo)</p>

<p>I even climbed to the top roof! Lots of hammering and nail pulling. I think I wrecked about 20 nails. The whole day was great weather, and in the afternoon we had shade, so it was perfect! Afterwards we all went to my house for dinner, where I made fried rice and pasta for everyone. That was interesting too; except John took half the fried rice!!! It was my first experience cooking for 10-12 people, and I think it went alright. =)</p>

<p><strong>day two</strong></p>

<p>Today, Mike and I returned to habitat. It was really rainy and muddy, but we were indoors most of the day. Our job was to put the pink insulation up around the house. Lots of monkey work to get up the different floors, and cutting insulation so that it fits the holes is pretty tough. The worst part is that the fibres get into your pores and make your arms itch (which is what I'm experiencing now.. =/) On the plus side, I got a free t-shirt! The Lutheran churches made some shirts, so both Mike and I got one. =)</p>

<p>I recommend everyone who has not yet tried volunteering for habitat to do so; you really gain an appreciation for the difficulty of trade work, and good old manual labour never hurt anyone. It doesn't matter how little you know, as they will teach you everything and they need all the hands they can get. Plus, it's a good cause! If you've got $60,000 to spare, you can even sponsor your own house!

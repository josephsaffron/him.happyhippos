          <p>Again, I find myself unable to find solace in the soft blankets of my comfy bed,but this time because I am too excited about something. I can't tell you what it is, but I can tell you about my weekend. =) It started off with me leading worship for fellowship, a pitiable rendition of &#8220;House of the Lord&#8221; (the only song I know how to play on guitar), but we had a good bible study nonetheless on the parable of the Talents. Saturday was a painfully early drive to waterloo to catch breakfast with an old friend (old as of CS 342 and late night coding). Then, off on a whirlwind tour of pretty much every single bookstore in waterloo, along with an interesting encounter with a text to speech machine. Surprisingly, the total amount I spent on books was a tiny fraction of the total amount I spent;. most of which was devoured by three CDs. I picked up a perl book for $0.95. What a steal! I highly recommend both the <a href="http://www.kwbookstore.on.ca/">KW Bookstore</a> and <a href="http://www.casabooks.com/">Casablanca Books</a>, both of which are incredible places to purchase usedAmPks on a variety of topics including religion, technology, and even plain old science fiction.</p>

<p>I recently picked up a book on Christian Ethics, an insightful look into many of the &#8220;grey areas&#8221; of Christian living. So far it's an interesting read, and it sort of sounds like a well written textbook. Feel free to ask to borrow it from me!</p>

<p>Anyway, I think I should give my pillow another chance. Otherwise, I'll fall asleep at work. again. which would be bad.</p>

<p>Update: I'll know by the end of tomorrow.</p>

<p>Update 2: Nothing yet;. guess I have to wait till monday.</p>

<p>Update 3: Tentative no as of 3:30 pm Tuesday</p>

<p>Update 4: Probably get to go. =)</p>

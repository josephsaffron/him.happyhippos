          <p>Saturday; and after two solid days of walking, gaming, and looking at things, I just needed a break. I spent the majority of my time just sitting around and watching the people walk by. I also took the most photos today, as compared to the entire trip. They'll be up later, but for now, here are some captions.</p>

<p>Well, after a hearty dinner at subway, it's time for our game of MEGA Twilight Imperium, 3rd edition! This is a huge board, and it was really intense. Almost everyone had a chance at victory, and just barely was stopped by everyone else. Finally, after a pretty intense turn (I opened all the wormholes), and after everyone was finished taking their turn, I came from behind to secure the victory by taking over the home systems of two different players. Hurrah! What an adrenaline rush. =) Afterwards, we went out to the <a href="http://www.steaknshake.com">Steak n Shake</a> where I had a frisco melt.. basically a grilled cheese sandwich with a steak patty inside. SO good! Especially at 11 pm. I think I've finally realised why americans are so fat. There are SO many fast food joints, where the food is so cheap, so abundant, and so good. Essentially, the Steak n Shake is a westernised version of Congee Wong, except with a LOT more fat. Pretty intense. Anyway, stay tuned for the pictures. =)</p>

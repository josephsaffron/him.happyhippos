          <p>Wow, another blog post. I think that I post so infrequently because I tend to write long essays every time I post, and I don't often have that much free time to write. Anyway, enough excuses, on to the meat!</p>

<div style="position:relative;float: right;padding: 1em;" width="50%">

<p>So this past weekend, I went with <a href="http://impromptu.sheepie.net">em</a> to <a href="http://ottawa.ca">Ottawa</a> for the <a href="http://winterlude.ca/bins/ncc_web_content_page.asp?cid=16296&amp;#038;lang=1">Winterlude Festival</a>. We both took Friday off, so we could maximise the use of our time, with a smaller fraction of our weekend spent driving.</p>

</div>

<p>The plan was that we would leave work early on thursday, and leave Toronto before rush hour. That didn't <em>quite</em> work out as planned, however; My manager scheduled a performance review from 4-5 pm, Thursday! He told me he tried to book me on Friday, but my schedule was full! Good thing I wrote my vacation day into my calendar! =)</p>

</div>

<p>Anyway, we finished a tiny bit early, but I was still anticipating bearing the brunt of Toronto rush hour. Fortunately, it wasn't that bad; a little side-street knowledge goes a long way towards beating the flood of cars that comes after work on a Thursday evening. We had dinner during our only stop to Ottawa, and we enjoyed a bacon cheese something burger. Don't quite remember what it was called, but it was good! I also opened my Valentine's day present from em. A very puzzling gift! She also made me some delectable cranberry chocolate creations; they are SO good! I had one this morning; it's going to take a lot of self control to keep from eating them all in one go. =)</p>

<p>From there, it was back on the road for us until we met Danny, em's friend, for bubbletea in Ottawa. It wasn't bad, only a bit powdery. We then went to Danny's house, the man who graciously provided a house for us to stay in while we were there. After a good night's sleep, it was tourist time, bright and early! We arrived at the Royal Canadian Mint, just in time for a tour of the production area. Though em had been there, she had never been present while the machines and workers were still active. Unfortunately, there weren't any 50c pieces available, and the circulation mint is in winnipeg, so there were no alternatives.</p>

</div>

<p>We then drove to Mont Ste. Marie for some snowboarding! Unfortunately, it was a bit icy, and the trails weren't really suited for snowboarders; they were narrow, and had many level sections where we had to unstrap and walk for a bit. The weather was gorgeous though, and it wasn't too cold! As we were finishing our last run, a couple snowmobiles were tailing us, because they were trying to close the runs. Because we were slow, they gave us a free lift to the bottom of the mountain. Quite an experience, zooming down the mountain on a motorised vehicle in the open air!</p>

</div>

<p>From there, we went to dinner with Leon and Danny, which we had at an excellent ribs place! The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, and the salad and soup bar were good enough to hold us over till the real food came.</p>

<p>After that, we went for a brief skate at Dow's Lake, but there was nothing around by the time we arrived. Then it was off to home, to play some <a href="http://blokus.com">Blokus</a>!</p>

<p>On Saturday, we spent the morning at the canal, which was completely frozen over, surprisingly! On Tuesday, the canal was completely closed, but a few nights of -20 weather caused it to freeze over by the time we arrived!</p>

<p>The weather was perfect for our visit, not too cold but cold enough to allow us to do everything we planned. It was quite a unique experience, skating the &#8220;World's longest skating rink&#8221;. Since I haven't skated in a few months, I really enjoyed the chance to stretch my winter legs again. After about an hour or so, we had to return to have lunch at Blue Cactus in Byward Market. The food there was excellent! From there, we explored the snow sculptures in the Parc Jacques-Cartier, racing down several ice slides. We even went down the family slide together. =) There were some really amazing sculptures there. My personal favourites were of a snowboarder and a figure skater. Definitely something not to be missed! After that, we went to em's relative's house for a delightful dinner of cranberry turkey. We stayed there for awhile, and heard all about their trip to China. Then it was back home to sleep.</p>

<p>Sunday, we had service at <a href="http://www.ottawacac.org/ESM/index2.html">OCAC</a>, then ate at Man's kitchen, a good place for chinese food. Because em knew the owner, we weren't charged tax (we suspect). Then, off to skate the rest of the canal with Nate, another of em's friends. We got about <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the way to the end, but we had to turn around because we didn't want to leave so late. On the way down, I passed by a member of the &#8220;Lost Children Service&#8221;. They were there to locate lost children, which wasn't unusual, but this particular member was about 10 years old! Pretty cool, enlisting children to find other children!</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun this trip, and we were so blessed to have such remarkable weather for our entire venture! I didn't get to see the Parliment buildings, but I'd like to return in the spring/summer so maybe I can take a look then!</p>

<p>By the way, I apologise for the state of the pictures. Their weird placement and order is because of a design flaw in my website. =p</p>

          <p>My first week of vacation hasn't been very productive; Although I've managed to finish 1 (only 1!!) book, I've done little else. Church gave a nice gift of a $15 gift card at staples for volunteering at the summer camp. That'll buy some school supplies! =) Today, I went shopping with my mom; looking for nothing in particular, just spending time before school starts again. My brother and sister are away on retreat, so there're three in in the family right now. =) When we went to Wal-Mart, I discovered a treasure trove of social dance cds! I of course picked them ALL up, cheaply.. $5 a pop! and we went to costco, where we bummed around on the comfy chairs and ate the free samples;. and left without buying anything! that's the first time I've ever done that. =)</p>

<p>After a quick dinner, I watched Pirates of the Carribean, which was a decent movie. No majojr plot holes, and I'm pretty satisfied with the experience, although we were sitting a bit close the the screen, so fast action scenes blurred by me. Anyway, that's my life;. tomorrow, I'm going to visit White Clarke, one of my old employees. =)</p>

<p>Oh, I uploaded a few photos of dinner for the choir members; we went to a pretty nice japanese restaurant. =)</p>

          <p>Because I am living in Mackenzie King Village next term, I have to sign up for resNet, since there isn't an option and it's bundled into housing costs. I heard a rumour last term about certain ports, like 27015 and 6112 (for the uninitiated, counterstrike and battle.net) being blocked. This is unacceptable, so I decided to find out more. After emailing the resnet office, I was confronted with a guy who obviously had no idea what he was doing. Conversation thread below, comments in bold:</p>

<p>I heard rumours of resnet blocking certain ports, like 27015, and I was</p>

<p>wondering if this was true and still in effect? Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Can you tell me which ports are in a slower queue, and how much slower this</p>

<p>queue is?</p>

<p>Hi there..Sorry I don,t have that kind of information. If you into CS you</p>

<p>should have np ..All though your ping will be a little higher then ussual.</p>

<p>It should still work fine. Better then being blocked entirely..</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>I swear, this guy sounds like a student, or at least someone who spends waaaay too much time on the net, but his email is adm.mail, so he's definately an administrator</strong></p>

<p>Hmm.. Thanks for your help! Do you know anyone who would have this</p>

<p>information, i.e. a Network Administrator, or an IST technician? As a</p>

<p>future user of ResNet, I'd like to know what exactly I am getting for my</p>

<p>$75.</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>~Joseph</p>

<p>p.s. TFC rocks!</p>

<p><strong>nothing wrong with that, right? just trying to be nice, perhaps; I don't even *play* TFC. But yeah, reasonable request to find out what I'm paying for</strong></p>

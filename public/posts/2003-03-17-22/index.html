          <p>Okay, I'm sure a lot of people who are more qualified than me have talked about this, but I just have to say something. So the US is almost assuredly going to declare war tonite on iraq, because of supposed weapons of mass destruction, which we <em>still</em> have not seen concrete evidence of. And yet, here sits North Korea, thumbing its nose at the US, <strong><em>declaring</em></strong> that it has weapons of mass destruction, test firing missles every which way, basically saying &#8220;screw you, UN, give us money cause we have nukes&#8221; and yet the US (or anyone else for that matter, save South Korea) does nothing. Meanwhile, we've got 220,000 US troops outside iraq, armed with everything from canada-manufactured LAVs to microwave heat rays, all set to invade this country, that so far has yet to be proven guilty of the crimes it has been charged with. And as far as I know, the UN councils aren't even TALKING about N. Korea. What's going on? Someone please tell me, because I am confused as hell. From what I've seen, George Bush isn't being very reasonable, and he is proving to the world that he isn't fit to govern.</p>

<p>and as far as war goes, it is a very scary thing. This is one christian who will be praying hard tonite. May God have mercy on our souls.</p>

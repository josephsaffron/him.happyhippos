          <p>Heard throughout the UW Hip Hop club, of which I am now a member. That's pretty funny, at least to me, since I am one of the LEAST co-ordinated people I know. =) And yet, it was so much fun! The dance we were learning was pretty complicated, and my problem was that I couldn't think ahead. I always tell people I have a two-word queue in my head, (which means that when I say a word, I have two words planned after it), meaning that I suck at public speaking. =p Well, when it comes to dancing, I have a zero-move queue, so I'm a JIT-dancer; (just-in-time) which usually leads to a lot of tripping, falling, hitting people, and general chaos. =p I think I'll go back though, if they don't kick me out. hehehe; It was a crazy workout. I was pretty soaked by the end, and there was sweat on the floor, creating friction, stalling people whilst they were trying to spin, causing collisions, which weren't pretty. There was this girl there, and I swear that she went to my high school, except that there's NO reasonable explanation for her presence here! She went to a school on the opposite side of the world, and she lives in Toronto! I'll try to get ahold of the member list to confirm her identity, since I didn't have an opportunity to talk to her (I left early). Anyhow, stats quiz in 15 minutes. I should start studying. =p</p>

          <p>I just realised something today as I was walking home from school. There is a distinct disadvantage in attending a school that requires so much walking around, especially if your body is not well equipped for such a task. To explain, I'm going to need some illustrations.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~j34wong/normal.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is a normal foot. The band at the bottom is a tendon that runs along the bottom of your foot, connecting the ball of your foot with the inside rear of your foot. It's what puts the spring in your feet as you walk! Now, I have flat feet, so my foot looks like the image below:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~j34wong/flat.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As I walk, the tendon is constantly stretched, pulling on the two points that it's attached to. Worse, the snow is forcing my walk to stretch the tendon even more, so the normally simple task of walking is causeing me immense amounts of pain. As I was coming back home, I was forced to rest many times, and almost collapsed in pain. But halfway home, I began to focus my mind on thoughts of home, and it felt like my feet were hurting less. As I concentrated on my destination, I was able to continue and make my way back. That's not to say that it was easy, but the journey and the pain was made easier by focussing in my goal. Kinda like life in that way.. though it's sometimes painful and fraught with difficulties, keeping your thoughts on the final destination makes the journey a little easier.</p>

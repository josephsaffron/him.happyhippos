          <p>Praise God! Statistics 231 has been completed, and not a mercy pass! I am SO happy; seriously, the only thing stopping me from running around outside the street yelling is that I already showered. Such a blessing! I was really really scared about this mark. I even talked to my prof! The exam was just brutalising. I feel like a huge load has been lifted off me! =) I'll still keep to my promise to reduce distraction, though. I NEVER want to have to go through that kind of uncertainty again, especially if its within my power to prevent it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I saw SWAT today, after helping out with VBS. Pretty good, a bit underdeveloped in terms of plot, but not bad for some live-action CS where the good guys win. Speaking of VBS though, I am SO exhausted. I gave at least 20 piggyback rides today, and had to watch over 10 children as they bowled, trying to keep them from danger. Sheer and utter madness. It was cosmic bowling, ultraviolet style. Tip to girls, btw, if your clothes are semi-translucent but opaque to regular vision, anything white you wear underneath it WILL glow under the ultraviolet light. So make sure you're wearing clothes that are fully opaque. =p</p>

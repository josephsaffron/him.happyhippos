Although there isn't a visible difference, this site has just undergone a massive overhaul. You may notice a little performance degradation, but that's because everything is being loaded from SQL Server now, allowing for HTML code in posts, and a whole host of neat features. =)

Our first meeting went well, and we got a chance to share about our goals, and our resolutions for the term. A lot of interesting suggestions for programs were given including skating, movie night, and Praying over Oranges. =D Hopefully, I'll be able to devote more time to organization for our meetings, and it may helped that I've written out a rough schedule for what I do once I get home. Budgeting time is easier than budgeting money, and my money budget just got demolished after [this](http://www.bulletin.uwaterloo.ca/2003/jan/31fr.html) happened. 15% Tuition Increase? are they mad? Unfortunately, this is a huge blow to my disposable income, rendering it almost negative. =( Maybe I'll just work more hours;

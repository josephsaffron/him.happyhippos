Yes, I know, I should be studying or sleeping, but I was reading [boundless.org](http://www.boundless.org/regulars/money_talks/a0001014.html) and they had posted a brilliant idea - Write down ten things you're thankful for today. So, here goes:

I'm thankful for Eric Cheng, sharing part of his delicious dinner with me today.
  
  
I'm thankful for the person sitting next to me during the exam, helping me stress less about it.
  
  
I'm thankful for JT for waking me up this morning.. and making me stay awake!
  
  
I'm thankful for Denise, who I practiced signing to today (even though she had no idea what I was &#8220;saying&#8221;).
  
  
I'm thankful for a chance to go skating, to have fun and take my mind of school for 40 minutes.
  
  
I'm thankful for Tim, who watched my laptop while I was having fun. =)
  
  
I'm thankful for the designers of SLC, who designed the handicap button to open locked doors and allow me into the only working fountain in SLC.
  
  
I'm thankful for a pleasant companion for lunch today, despite a misplaced ring.
  
  
I'm thankful to JT (again!) for bringing me dinner at SLC.
  
  
I'm thankful for my cell group, for reminding me indirectly to spend time with God this morning.

I can't just be thankful for ten things; there are too many! Here are more:
  
  
I'm thankful for Waiki, giving me a maple cookie when I was hungry. =)

Hah! I don't need em anymore;. check <a href="http://www.japantoday.com/e/?content=news&#038;cat=4&#038;id=266447" target="_blank">this</a> out! Been sitting in a lab all day trying to understand stats notes; I'm almost through chapter 7. I am soooo behind it's not funny. More on the picnic, it was at Shade's Mill, and there were no bugs around at all! Even though it took about 45 minutes to get the canoes because the attendant was sooooooo slooooooooooow, the canoeing trip was a fun excursion, especially the race. We placed second, after pushing another boat WAY off course. =) The way back was filled with childrens songs, including great hits like &#8220;There's a hole in the bottom of the sea&#8221;, and &#8220;We are the pirates who don't do anything&#8221;, as well as &#8220;The Water Buffalo song&#8221;. All in all an excellent vocal excercise!

On Egyptian cuisine, I really liked the humus. I should make some more, and hopefully the recipe from when J and I participated in the Josiah cooking contest is still kicking around on my laptop. Heck, I could make some for the potluck on thursday! =) I'm in the process of coming up with a new design for this site, so don't fret if you begin to see strange things appearing out of nowhere.

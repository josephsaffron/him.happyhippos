Wow, the weekend was gorgeous! Not at all like the blizzard that is currently outside my window. =p It was so warm, in fact, that I was walking about in a t-shirt (yes, outside!) to shovel and clear my back patio. =) With my brother and sister, I made snow sculptures out of the remaining pieces of snow and ice, and we had a really fun time! I'll have photos up soon; now I REALLY want a digital camera. =(
  
  
If the Dell Axim for $118 deal had gone through, I'd have enough for it, but unfortunately, they cancelled it, and they didn't even have the decency to send out an email! =( Hopefully someone will complain! That aside, I don't think I have enough to spend on a digital camera for this term, especially since I have to save up for a double term! I need more jobs, perhaps; hehe; 

**Things to look forward to:**

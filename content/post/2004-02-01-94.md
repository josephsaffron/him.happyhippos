I've decided to really get to know my city this term, rather than do what I've been doing in previous terms, which mainly consists of sitting and wasting time in my room every day. Tonite I went to a spectacular display of fireworks and drumming skill. I mean these guys were amazing; they were _Les Commandos Percu_, which translates as &#8220;the striking commandos&#8221;, and strike they did. Their intensity in drumming was matched only by the awe-inspiring display above them, perfectly timed fireworks, in a dazzling display, delighting both eyes and ears.

Quite honestly, I've never seen anything like it, and I was blown away by their perfectly timed drumming and the _style_ that they did all this. If ever anyone fit the description of &#8220;cool&#8221;, these guys were it. =)
  
  
I took a few videos, but nothing can compare to the experience of actually being there! It's too bad I couldn't find anyone to go with me; =/ You guys missed out! =p 

I'll see if I can post some stuff, but it seems our server is running out of room.. (my fault!) so don't hold your breath. =) Maybe a small sample wouldn't be too bad;..

Okay, I just took another look through the photos that I took, and some of the videos, and I am just wowed all over again. 

Here you can see one of the commandos, and the drum that he is wearing. They seem to be attached by some sort of hook, but it allows them complete freedom of movement, as you will see later.

Here again you can see the drums, and there are four guys in total doing this incredible drumming. (Alexis, you should've been here!)

A close up of one of the guys doing a solo. Note his determined expression.

And now, the moment you've all been waiting for - video links:

This was one of the most amazing parts of the performances. Fire was just spewing out of the large drum.

Then the fire started doing circles around the drum; can you see it in the picture?
  
  
Oh, forget it, here's the [video](http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~j34wong/04-02-01 Feu 025.avi)! =)

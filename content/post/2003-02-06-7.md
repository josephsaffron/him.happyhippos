_american idol_  
I was watching american idol yesterday, and I will have to admit, I am a fan of the show. Kimberly was not allowed to proceed, even though it looked like she was going to (she's very pretty), and I was very disappointed. I still can't get over how _nice_ Kimberly was; even after losing, she still went to encourage all the others, and keep a smile on.. I don't know if I'd be able to do that, after losing a competition like that, it's just so incredible. Anyways, this whole blog was just an excuse to test some more capabilities that I added this site, so I think I'll stop talking, _especially_ about how much I like American Idol. =P

My mom has this colourful term for buying and selling rapidly, and I think it comes from real estate. It happens when you buy a house, and then sell it without living in it for a profit. I've been criticised for buying and selling things rapidly, and I actually have my brother a little hooked on [rfd](http://forums.redflagdeals.com), where he's a known seller of old electronics. =) Sometimes, I think having an itchy purchase trigger finger (especially for online deals) is a good thing, because no matter what you purchase, usually you can return it. When you jump on that online deal, you're actually just buying yourself another 30 days to decide if it's worth it. If you don't make the purchase though, you'll lose the deal. I guess the downside of this strategy is that you end up with a few more items than you'd have if you totally ignored the updates, but yeah, &#8220;they were really good deals!&#8221;. =) 

Along an entirely different vein, I think it would be interesting to implement &#8220;tags&#8221; on this site, so I can indicate which blogs relate to travel, food, photography, etc. What do you think?

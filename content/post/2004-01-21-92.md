As some of you know, I've started working at the Ontario Teacher's Pension Plan. Apparently the most commonly known fact about this company is that they own the Toronto Maple Leafs. \*shrug\* I didn't know that when I started. However, there is no denying that they have money, and lots of it. I mean, I just got back from a conference in [Hockley Valley](http://www.hockley.com), where the estimated cost of staying is $250 / night. The bill for dinner came to $1440, and the bar tab came to ~ $1600. The rooms were _nice_ too! Two queen size beds, sofa, outdoor sitting area, and couch area. There was a spa, a salon, and a fitness center all on my floor, and the whole place was just really cozy and nice. The ballroom area was unbelievable, I would love to dance there. Massive chandeliers, huge floorspace, and quality flooring made this the perfect place to waltz the night away. =) They gave out sweatshirts, swiss army knives, and a ton of highlighters and pens. I really learned a lot from BOOPSLA (the name of the conference, a play on the [OOPSLA](http://oopsla.acm.org/)) and next time, I hope to have the opportunity to lead a seminar. =) 

Anyway, I've now that I've decorated my workspace a bit more, I've decided to post a photo so you can all see the area, and so that [s.c.](http://spaceinthewho.blogspot.com) can identify where I sit:

Pretty nice, huh? And you can see two of the five free 8&#215;10 glossies that I got from Japan Camera. They're pretty high quality, except they didn't really cut the left one very well. It's okay, free is free, right? By the way, the reason I have time to type all this out isn't that I'm a big slacker (although I'm not denying it) but rather because my computer will shortly be reformatted due to its non-working state, which I obviously had no hand in at all. =) Since it'll take a few hours, I'm pretty much killing time till I leave, since there's nothing that I can really do. Bottom line is, work is good. =)

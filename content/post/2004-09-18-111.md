So it seems I'm going to be taking Databases &#8220;Distance Ed&#8221; next term; crazy! =) I need to be disciplined; sigh. In other news, I have a dilemma; I need to lead worship next next week, but I also need to go to waterloo for saturday; what to do! =/ This requires much ponderance. Oh, and since I've joined extreme fitness, that also requires a whole other level of discipline; working out four times a week will probably sap a lot of my strength. =p Oh well! We'll see how it turns out!

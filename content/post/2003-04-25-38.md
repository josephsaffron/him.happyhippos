no, this isn't about me stalking that camera guy. For my work report, I had to find out about a few pieces of software. one of them was called Verity UltraSeek. All I gave them was my email address. Somehow, he traced the domain, went to our website, called the company, and asked for me. the guy CALLED me!! and now he won't go away. He's bugging me incessantly, and I'm getting very annoyed. It's interesting to be on the recieving end of such desperation. I remember back when I was working at espresso, and while I was working, I'd hear the sales guy doing almost exactly the same thing to other people, and I didn't think it was that bad (and to tell you the truth, he WASN'T that bad) but at least I know the story from both sides now. 

Anyway, I just got back from my free pizza lunch, and I've very sleeeeepy after eating 8 square slices, a root beer, a ginger ale, and a piece of chocolate cake. I hope I can stay awake for the remaining 3.5 hours!

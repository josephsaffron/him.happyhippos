It's the night before I leave for hk; and I can't sleep, because I've got SO much on my mind. The last 24 hours have been a blur of activity. From preparing to convo to dining to photographs to packing to flying, it's like my life's on fast forward. My heartbeat is running pretty high, and I'm just sitting still, trying to get to bed. I can't believe I'm graduated, too; that in itself is pretty unbelievable. One of my friend's cards really hits the nail on the head. The card text reads: &#8220;Some call it graduating! Some call it commencement! ;.. But in your case, let's just call it a miracle!&#8221; hehehe; so true. So many points through the university career which were iffy, like CS341, CS342, struggles with teachers, classmates, friends; and a killer french exam. But still; God brought me through it. Each and every step of the way, He impelled me to finish what I started, what he gifted me with. He gave me the acceptance letter, and now He is giving me the diploma. Honestly? There's no way I could've done it on my own. My friends and classmates can attest to that. =) So now, in graduating, I can give all the glory to Him who gives me strength, who surmounts all difficulties, the ruler of heaven and of earth. And on that note, I think I can rest, secure in His peace.

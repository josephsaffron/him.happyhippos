I've been having some fun this term whipping up random things for lunch or dinner. I guess my biggest problem has been that most of the stuff I make looks good, smells good, but ends up tasting rather bland. For example, my pasta sauce, my chasiu-omelete, and my bizzare stewed veal mix with carrots all tasted rather bland. Well, I just discovered that time does make a difference. =) a little marination, a little udon goodness, and we can turn out something like this:

looks good huh? It smelled good.. and tasted good too! =) I really do enjoy cooking; and any tips would be appreciated! And if you ever want to try some, just come over! I make no promises on how edible it is though; haha
  
  
If you just want to come over for dessert, I won't object. Next week I'll be making Apple Crisp! Till next time, this is Joseph's cooking show, signing off.

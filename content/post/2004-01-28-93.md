Today, I went to the second Toronto athletic event of my life;. box tickets, for the Leafs game. As Daniel will readily attest, I know next to nothing about hockey. Why is it that everytime I go to a game, I get awesome seats and know nothing about the game? I thought it was no more complicated than sending the ball/puck/cylinder/miscellaneous object into the net/basket/hole/bowl, but apparently there are some deep nuances or something. =p The last event I went to was a Raptor's game, and I had platinum courtside seats. I mean I could reach out and rub the players' heads. =p Not that I'm complaining; =)

Driving conditions are fun! Imagine Initial-D style driving, only in a van, using a footbrake! That's what I was doing on almost every turn. Intense fun, especially when I can recover without doing a full stop. =) I think today I've finally managed to pay back all the debt I owed to people/credit card companies, which is a good feeling. I am going to try to avoid debt as much as possible now (although I still put everything on my credit card, to gain points). I wonder if I can put some of my tuition through on my credit card? Since I can use my WatCard to pay tuition, I should be able to transfer a balance from my credit card, and use at least that amount to pay for tuition. Yeah, that's what I'll do; =)
  
  
Points for the masses! It all adds up! Next, I should try to organise something which involves hotel stays, so I can get mad air miles; =)

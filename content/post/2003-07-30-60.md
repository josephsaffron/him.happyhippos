I just slept 13 hours, after falling asleep studying 342. And My stomache is reminding me that I haven't eaten in 15 hours. I'm feeling awake ( a bit ), and the cs342 project is done, albeit with livelocking. =p Regardless, it is done, and I can spend the next 56 hours studying for 360, for which I feel woefully under-knowledged. \*sigh\*
  
  
It's hard to find a bright spot anywhere. I'm sure there is one though.

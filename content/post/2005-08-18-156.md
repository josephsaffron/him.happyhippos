I'm in the process of redoing my website, but I figured I'd trickle some of the technical changes back down to this old blog; I've been doing some work on my [friend's](http://impromptu.sheepie.net) website, and because of the challenges of perl, I was forced to write cleaner code without many of the hacks that I did on this site (especially with the comments! I mean seriously, what was I thinking, running a separate query for every weblog on the page to get the comment count?!?!). Using joins and count functions, instead of running four or five queries every time the page was loaded, now it's down to ONE query, which is ONLY run after the database is updated! sweet, eh? That should add a performance boost to this site, not that many people visit anymore. =p Let me know if you notice a difference, and if anything breaks (I had to rename a DB table).

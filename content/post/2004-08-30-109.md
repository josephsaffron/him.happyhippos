First day of work, and it's been interesting; catching up with all the people here. Everyone went on vacation, so they've got lots of stories to tell! I have my nice workstation back, and I never knew how much I missed dual monitor until today! =) I still have all my old programs on here, everything's designed to make my life easier. =) I even managed to get ICQ working, and it only took me 2-3 hours! HTTP tunnelers rock. =) They're hard to configure though; I had to spend a few minute son the phone setting it up ony my brother's site. Fortunately, it didn't take too long. Oooh, I have a chance to get Allegria tickets for Thursday, Sept. 19, 1pm. Anyone interested? Almost full price though, so not much of a discount. Oh, and if anyone wants CNE tickets, please buy mine! I bought two advances tickets, $7 each, no chance to use them. Someone take them off my hands! Okay, I think it's time to leave work now; I LOVE these 7.25 hour days. =)

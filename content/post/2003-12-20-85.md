For those of you who haven't seen my room, this is what it looks like:

Now, those of you who know me well enough to know what I do and do not own, There is one thing that is out of place here.
  
  
That's right, you guessed it; I only have ONE laptop. And yet, no, your eyes do not decieve you, for there on my ghetto makeshift desk is a SECOND laptop; That's right, an Inspiron 8600 to be exact. You may recall that I previously emailed a Mr. Michael Dell, CEO of Dell Corp. Well, apparently, he forwarded it to an Executive Support Specialist here in Canada, who promptly offered to replace my laptop with a new one. After all the jokes and everything, I have a brand new laptop! Very shiny, and very silver! FYI, that's G sleeping in the photo on the far right, and CNE's gorgeous summer fountain on the left side.

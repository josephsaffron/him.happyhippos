Went golfing over the weekend, for the first time! It was sooo much fun, but I'm sore in so many strange places now. Muscles that I didn't even know _existed_ are hurting now; =( But it was worth it! I can hit the ball pretty far; one of the most perfect shots I made nailed the golf-ball-collection truck dead on, way in the back of the tent. Now THAT was a sweet shot.. hahaha; I'd go again in a heartbeat. The driving range is the place to be! The only problem is, I have no whacking-sticks. Maybe I can find some for cheap, somewhere. After that, we watched Memories, a weird set of three anime movies. I didn't understand that at all. But it was cool, I came away with some new knowledge, or perhaps a re-iteration of existing knowledge:
  
Stupid people should not have power.

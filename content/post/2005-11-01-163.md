My mom decides to use an entertainment book coupon to treat me on the last day they can be used, and the closest restaurant is Smiling Jack's, across the street. Our experience was less than stellar. In fact, it was downright terrible. First, the under-dressed waitress kept kept touching my arm to illustrate her points. The food was dry and portions were smaller than a lot of other restaurants we've been to. Then, when we went to use our coupon, the waitress denied us. There's a $12 limit on the coupon, which is a buy-one-get-one-free coupon. Typically, if you go over the limit, they just discount the $12. However, in this case they denied us the chance to use the coupon. When we inquired why, the waitress seemed to be more interested in covering her butt than in our customer satisfaction. When we had questions, she started avoiding our table. Needless to say, she didn't get much tip, and we're definitely NEVER going back to that restaurant.

For the first time today, I rollerbladed to work. If you know the area, it's quite hilly, and there were a few close calls with the pavement. It was quite intense, and I managed to shave about 6-8 minutes off of my arrival time. I don't know if I'd do it again though. It was getting quite dicey, especially along King St towards Victoria, which are both major intersections. The terrain slopes downhill towards this intersection, and I haven't quite mastered the art of slowing down within a narrow strip of sidewalk. Thank goodness for spare parking lots which I used to turn in order to reduce speed! My feet hurt a lot though, I think I've lost a lot of strength in my feet for rollerblading, since I haven't done it in awhile. For now, it's definitely my top priority to get a bike. Maybe I'll splurge a bit for a good one. =) Any recommendations?

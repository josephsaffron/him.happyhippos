Why oh why are women's shirt buttons backwards? I recently noticed this phenomenon, so I did a little research and this is the information I came up with. To answer this question, we must go back into the ages of antiquity, when men dressed themselves and women didn't. Since it was considered bad luck to be left handed, everyone learned to use their right hand. Thus, while men dressed themselves, using their right hands to insert their buttons into the button holes, women were dressed by someone else, having their buttons buttoned by someone in front of them. This custom of making reverse buttons for women carried on through the ages, now having infiltrated the zipper industry as well. Like the low cross-bar to differentiate a girls' bike from a boys', this tradition has carried on despite our attempts to androgenise everything.

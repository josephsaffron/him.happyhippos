I'm having difficulty selling the tungsten, altough I _do_ have a promising offer from one guy for $490. We'll see how that pans out. =) The camera guy hasn't contacted me back yet, and if he hasn't by tonite, I'm going to call him again. Using the net's resources, I have tracked down where he lives, and who his father is (and the fact that he's 51!) so I'm pretty sure I can't get scammed. but we'll see. Anyways, I found an article explaining why [women can't play counterstrike well](http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993628). Solution? Get a wider screen, girls. =) Speaking of which, we currently have 11 registered gamers for [the lan party](GeekFest). If you guys know of anyone who'd like to come, send them an invite! We welcome more players, especially ones that are willing to be duct taped to the ceiling. =D

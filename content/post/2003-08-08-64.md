As I exit the room of my final exam today, there is no sense of elation at having completed another school term, no sense of satisfaction. Instead, I only feel exhaustion, coupled with a growing sense of dread at the possibility of having to retake statistics. With next to no sleep, I head hope with a heavy heart. The only thing that gives me comfort is knowing that my success or failure rests entirely within the hands of God, as I have done the best I could in the little time I alotted for that course. Perhaps this is a wakeup call, to force me to realise that I must put more effort into the work of my hands, in order to succeed. Whatever the intended lesson here, I have learned one thing. Never again will I allow a course to get ahead of me. This is my resolution, then: to be at most a lecture behind every course, attending each class, actively minimising any distractions. \*sigh\*

Now, perhaps, I may get a chance to rest, although I am quite sure that it will not be fitful. May God have mercy on my soul.

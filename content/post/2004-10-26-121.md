So for those of you who haven't guessed yet, I'm not in Toronto anymore. I've been given permission by my company to go to [OOPSLA](http://www.oopsla.org), all expenses paid! =)

_The conference is held in the Vancouver Convention and Exhibition Centre_

OOPSLA is a conference put on by the ACM, and it's been a great learning experience. I had a chat yesterday with the lead architect for the two Mars Rover Landers! He works at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Caltech, under the employ of NASA. It was fun talking about all the different challenges in designing the software, not the least of which was the fact that they're running on a 20 mhz processor! One of the latest problems they've been working on is autonomous probes, since it takes something like 40 minutes for a round trip radio signal to communicate to the mars rover. Talk about lag! Anyway, I'm having a really great time here. The view is incredible, and Vancouver has got to be one of the most gorgeous cities I have ever seen. I'm staying at the Fairmont Waterfront Hotel, right by the harbour, with a great view of the waterfront.

_the view from my room_

I haven't really gotten a chance to tour the city, since so many of my friends here are busy. I did take a trip up Burnaby Mountain, courtesy of bp's bright yellow vehicle. A hailstorm drove us quickly away, but not before bp snapped this gem of a photo:

I've never seen a mountain before, and the sight is simply awesome. You really start to feel small when you look at the massive mountains carved out by God's hands. Creation testifies to God's glory. As I was flying in, I gazed in wonder at the canyons. It looked like God had simply taken a finger and started drawing in the earth. The sight really took my breath away.

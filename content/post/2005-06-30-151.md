I hate rain. I'm not talking about the once-in-a-while summer storm downpour that clears the air and creates gorgeous rainbows. I'm talking about the drizzling kind that can make you feel miserable, even after you're out of it. For hot weather, once you're out if it, in a sheltered place, you're okay. Same with cold weather, excluding sunburn and frostbite. But rain clings to your clothes even after you're in a dry area, extending the amount of time that you feel gross. Hong Kong has been constantly pouring down rain, and I've been stuck indoors. This is just one of the reasons why I would never want to live/work in hk.

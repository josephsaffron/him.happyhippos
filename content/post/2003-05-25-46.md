I was thinking this past weekend, especially in light of recent events, about the issue of fairness. There's a lot of emphasis on &#8220;giving people what they deserve&#8221;, and there always has been. In fact, the oldest law in history is that of the &#8220;eye for an eye&#8221;. Even as Christians, we reward those deserving, and we punish those who are not. For example, this past friday night, we went to a resurant, and we recieved pretty bad service. Natural instinct suggests that we leave a low tip. So, then, I did. All night though, I felt guilty, and I kept thinking about it. How could I have let such petty concerns sway my judgement like that? Because of my actions, I may have missed an opportunity to demonstrate the tenets that I believe in. Romans 12 says this: &#8220;If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. &#8221; If God gave us what we deserved, it'd all be over right now. But He didn't, and instead, He demonstrated the ultimate act of mercy, forgiving all my wrongdoing. How can I do less, on such a trivial matter?

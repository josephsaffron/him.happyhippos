I've always wondered why females feel the need to go to the washroom in herds. At a nice dinner, or a prom or whatever, the instant a girl announces that she is going to the washroom, the entire female population at the table will get up and go with her. I've always wondered why that was, and what they do in such a large group, with such small washrooms.
  
  
Anyways, yesterday, another secret of feminine hygiene was revealed to me. 

Guys, get this: _girls don't sit on public toilet seats!_
  
  
Instead, apparently, they &#8220;cho mo ying dung&#8221; (invisible chairs, for the non-cantonese readers), performing a delicate balancing act while they do their business. Don't ask how this topic came up, it's related to questions about the above statement. Now I know something that I never needed to know, and didn't want to know. Illusions of clean female washrooms are being burst one by one. Ah well, I'll just try to erase this little tidbit of knowledge from memory. =p

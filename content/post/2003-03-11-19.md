one word. incredible. the stories shared on friday night really impacted me, and challenged the way that I think. I realized just how blessed I was when I was growing up, and I felt a renewed desire to help those less fortunate than me. My friends have gone through so much; Marianne's song spoke to me, especially the line &#8220;I will not try, I will rely&#8221;. Those words rang very true, especially in this time when I have so many things to worry about, so many decisions to make. Instead of taking on tasks based on my own abilities, God was saying to just trust in Him, even if the tasks seem impossible.

It was great to be able to see so many people, and catch up with my friends in waterloo! I even got to try out the Warcraft 3 Expansion beta! =D It's really really cool; but I ended up not getting to much sleep. On the drive back, I was the passenger, and so it was my job to talk with the driver and keep her awake, but I started daydreaming (my eyes were closed) and I had this really strange image of her having a translucent-purple cable-modem, and I was going to ask her why she had a purple cable-modem, but I caught myself just in time. That would've been a weird experience. Why a purple cablemodem, I don't know. Chalk it up to randomness I guess. =)

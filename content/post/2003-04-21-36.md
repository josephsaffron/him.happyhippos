There is SO much leftover chocolate at the office! I really should control myself, but it's soooooo good! It's not the super sweet, sugar-laced kind, it's the chocolatey goodness kind, and I'm craving another piece as I type this, but I think I will not take anymore pieces. =p
  
  
Incidentally, the eBay camera guy said he shipped the camera, however, he has not provided a tracking number, even though there is insurance on the item. I'm finding some holes in his story, although they can be explained away. I have asked for a copy of the package receipt, and if they fail to provide it, I will have to start pushing them on the holes in the story. I'm covered under eBay's insurance, but there's a $25 processing fee. =( Anyways, I'll hunt him down, I have his name, address, and phone number. =p I even found a photograph of the house next door to his. We'll see how far this goes;

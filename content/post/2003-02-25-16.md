After getting caught in a snowstorm and a huge traffic jam, I decided I would wait out the storm in Male Technology Paradise, Futureshop. =) Alright, I'll admit it, I was looking for the new Bond cd (four violinists, not James Bond. =P). While perusing the value section, I discovered the Avril Lavigne cd, conveniently low priced, and since I really like the quality of her voice, I picked it up. Both these cds are amazing! If you get a chance, pick them up (although the cover of the Bond cd shows them looking a little skanky). Bond's actually a group of classically trained violinists, who play to a heavy beat, and the first song is the DeBeers diamond song, and surprisingly, the bonus song is the James Bond theme song! Hilarious. =) Anyways, Work is done, home time!

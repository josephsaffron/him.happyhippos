In case you haven't noticed, <www.regularxpression.com> is now a top level domain, so update your bookmarks accordingly. Today has been pretty relaxed (as usual), and nothing eventful happened, aside from a pleasant surprise this morning on the ttc. It turns out that some of the eglinton 34 buses have upholstered seats! The only problem is, with seat dividers eliminated, it is difficult to isolate just where a seat ends and another begins. This problem is compounded by the fact that the seats are pretty new, so the slightest motion of the bus causes bums of various sizes to slip around with no traction whatsoever. Luckily, I was late, so the bus was relatively uncrowded, and nothing untoward happened.  
Anyways, although my supervisor returned today, there was no new work for me to do, and so I read through a set of online books about programming. These are _very_ good books, and they are in print, but the author has posted them online, for free download, no strings attached. &#8220;Thinking in Java&#8221;, and &#8220;Thinking in C++&#8221;, are both excellent resources for the experienced programmer, and contain sufficient detail for the beginner programmer too! You can find them [here](http://64.78.49.204/).

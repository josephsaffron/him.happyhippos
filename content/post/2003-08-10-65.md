I just re-read my post, and realised that it was more than slightly melodramatic. =P Then again, I had _just_ finished writing it, so I guess I had a right to be a bit upset. =) Anyhow, I feel better now, especially after the wedding I attended today. =) Jack Wong, my conductor, and Cass Leung, a friend from church, got MARRIED today! =) Weddings are always so happy; I love watching weddings. And the coolest part about todays wedding was that Jack sang for Cass! I am definitely gonna do that for my wedding, if I ever get married. A duet would be even better! It was soooo cool, and he's SO good! =) I got to see so many people that I haven't seen in forever; I'll post photos, maybe; but the photos i have aren't that great. I'm still learning how to use this new camera. There're so many functions, I need to learn more. =) I think I'll spend my vacation time visiting people around toronto. Maybe taking in the sights; like the Ex. =) okay, ss prep time;

Google's motto is &#8220;Do No Evil&#8221;. However, their gmail ads leave something to be desired. I was writing out an email to my friends who went camping with me about their final costs. It just so happened that all the campers were chinese. Imagine my suprise when I happen to glance over at the automatically generated sponsored links! Just because we have chinese last names, Google seems to think we want to learn kung fu! Click <a href="images/blog/racist.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> to see for yourself..

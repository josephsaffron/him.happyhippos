I have fully enabled the RSS feed from this site. The address for it is: <http://www.regularxpression.com/weblog/rss/rx.xml>. As far as I know, it is working, so feel free to play with it. =) The RSS version is 2.0, and it should work fine for any viewers compatable with any of the .91/.92 versions. 
  
and we're going to war. huzzah. but not us, which is good. =) Canada refuses to take part;. wheeee!

Yay! I have secure-ish posting set up. This is much better than before, where anyone who knew the address to the posting page could make updates to my weblog. =P Now only \*I\* can post, and you all can't! Except that my hand now hurts so much that I can't type anymore. =P This is with my left hand only, cuz though my right hand is feeling a little better, I don't want to strain it;

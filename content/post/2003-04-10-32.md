~joseph, 2003

Well, I've finally decided on my treat for this term: A Palm Tungsten T, with a free 0.3 MP camera. Normally retailing for $599, I am getting this sweet item for $379. This'll satisfy my desire to take photos, as well as replace my broken clie. And it's SO small! It's quite amazing actually. I'll purchase it as soon as Dell releases the charge on my credit card for the Axims, which will happen in exactly three business days. Anyways, I sold all three cordless keyboards, so that should add a little buffer to my spending limit. =p

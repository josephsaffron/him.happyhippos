I've recently been reading up on [LifeHacker](http://lifehacker.com), a blog on getting things done. It's all about little tips and tricks for getting things done, both in the digital world, and in the real world. This includes everything from simple tricks like having a desktop background that categorises the different files and folders on your computer desktop, to sites like [Hundredpushups.com](http://hundredpushups.com) which is a training program to do one hundred pushups, for anyone. I've also been recently playing with my newly purchased (courtesy of Shoppers Optimum points) Wii and Wii Fit game console. And then I came across this little [gem of an article](http://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/commentary/games/2008/08/gamesfrontiers_0811). It compares weight watchers to an RPG. It sounds unbelievable, but more and more I think this model is being applied, from a national scale (think carbon credits for corporations) right down to making chores into a competition, in Kindergarten. In changing dull, ordinary tasks (which are good for you, of course!) into a game system that rewards you, or even better (for guys, at least) a competition where you can beat out the other &#8220;players&#8221;, we can turn almost everything into a fun challenge. In fact, it's my belief that the most successful people are doing this daily, not even thinking about it. For the rest of us, there are games. It almost makes me shiver when I think of how [Augmented Reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) is going to change our world.

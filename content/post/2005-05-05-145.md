Now that I've started a full time job, it seems that I have more time in the evening. I was talking to a friend the other night though, and post-work energy levels seem to be much lower than post-school energy levels (perhaps because at school there is more to do than sit at a computer all day). Anyway, I've decided that I want to do a (fairly) major overhaul of the site, since it's pretty simple right now. My area of expertise is in software and implementation, however, and my design/presentation skills leave something to be desired. That's why I need your help. Ideas, suggestions, comments, questions, just direct them to me in the comments section of this post. If you have any requests, now would be a good time to put them in. =) Oh, and I started resuming my daily excercise routine; I think all this excellent toronto food is making me fat. =p With that, I'll leave you with an excerpt from the song I'm listening to:

_I am alive in this moment
  
  
In this moment I am found
  
  
I am alive in this moment
  
  
In this moment I belong_

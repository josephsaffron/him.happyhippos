since I haven't posted in a looooong time, here're two posts, this one _far_ less serious than the last one. I realised again today how mo liu my thought pattern goes. Here's what I was thinking about as I was walking home just now: the word propulsion. The root of it is &#8220;propel&#8221;, yet there is a noun version of of that doesn't contain some of the root. I was trying to think of as many as I could, but this is as far as I got, and maybe you can help!
  
  
propel -> propulsion
  
  
compel -> compulsion
  
  
repel -> repulsion
  
  
and one more, which I can't remember now, so I'll put it up later.

With all the things that are happening in my life, a new job, new relationships, new environment, I decided to release a new version of this site. It's cleaner and more intuitive, easier to update and manage. I've fixed a lot of old hacks, and improved the performance a little. Although some of the features have been taken down for maintenance, hopefully the site will be just as easy to read and navigate as always. Enjoy!

_Darkness reigns in blackest night
  
  
When none can see beyond themselves
  
  
Still the fluttering birds alight
  
  
on invisible branches to rest</p> 

Crimson roses lie asleep
  
  
swaying in the wind
  
  
silent they their secrets keep
  
  
awaiting the breath of day

Black to tiniest tinge of blue
  
  
The sky begins to lighten
  
  
Rays peek over horizon's edge
  
  
Empyrean castles brighten

Life kindles in sparrow song
  
  
As the world awakens
  
  
Roses open, their blossoms full
  
  
beauty completely unshaken</i>

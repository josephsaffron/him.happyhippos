So, yesterday, I'm walkin' to MC, extremely late for my cs class. I run into R, my current dance partner, sitting next to another guy, so I stop by to say hi. Then she introduces him as &#8220;C, my boyfriend&#8221;. At this point I'm totally at a loss for words. I'm trying to figure out what is going on, so I mumble something about being late for my class, and walk off.

Now, I'm thinking, why did she accept? I know that a lot of people have open relationships like that, but I still think it's a bit weird, especially since I don't know R that well, and I didn't know C at all. Maybe it's just me, I just kinda felt uncomfortable in that situation. So, I ended up switching classes to the intermediate class, with another friend.
  
  
Maybe I'm cursed to have weird encounters with members of the opposite sex, I mean, just a few days ago, I sort of accidentally proposed to someone. THAT was not too bright. =p Hopefully, everything will work out in the end. Although try as I might, I will never understand females. I think that task is better left to their Maker. =)

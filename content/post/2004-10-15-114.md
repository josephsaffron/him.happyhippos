sigh. Still don't know the date of my midterm yet. It is incredibly difficult to take a course intended for the classroom via distance education. Not so much the lectures as the fact that you can't ask for help. =( Admitedly, the assignments aren't that hard, but there is no verification or checking of answers, that is typical when you are in school. Anyway, the newsgroup is almost empty of posts and I am getting worried. Is there no one that cares about this class? Databases is supposed to be one of the easier courses, and for that I am glad. Next term should be pretty light. Only one fourth year cs! my schedule is as follows:

CS456 (Networks)
  
  
Psych 207 (Cognitive Processes)
  
  
Psych 314 (Children's Thinking)
  
  
Psych 334 (Theories of Individual Counselling)
  
  
Soc 101 (With Trinh! yay!)

A lighter term means I'll have time to enjoy my final (yes I'm graduating!) term at the University of Waterloo. Hopefully, I'll have more time to devote to extra curricular activities like badminton, social dance, any instructional classes that take my fancy. =) Also, my sister has an interview in Cambridge, so she'd be around for my last term.. yay! =)

Next term promises to be full of interesting things; we'll see how it goes. For now, I should do some work. =)

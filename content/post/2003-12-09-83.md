Setting: forest path leadaing from UW to Westmount and University

A dark night, and two students, walking quietly home, after a full day of studying. Even the full moon's light was drowned out by the branches of the forest. They whispered in hushed voices, conversing of the days events, planning the next day of studying. Quiet whispers that boomed like shouts across the silent path. A hooded man caught sight of the pair, and began to walk faster for a better look. Closer, the hooded man crept, silently taking in the world around. Ever more close, ever more silent, he walked down the beaten path, watching. Until he reached the two, one in a burberry scarf, one in woolen mittens. A meter behind, he broke his silence, 

&#8220;boo.&#8221;

The once silent street echoed with their startled screams, filling the night air with sound. The pair ran down the street, but turned to gain a closer glance. A desperate glance to see the source of their fear. But before they clearly saw the source, they heard the sound;

laughter.

For the first time, today, I got to sit on the _other_ end of the table, taking on the role of the interviewer. Suprising how many students didn't realise that I was another co-op; =) Anyway, I should elaborate. I went with a full-timer and another co-op up to Waterloo today, to interview some students for my current position. It was a fascinating experience, and I learned a lot about what _not_ to do during an interview:
  


  * don't focus/stare at only one interviewer, if you've got several


  * use examples liberally; prospective employers love examples. we'd much rather have those than the &#8220;right answer&#8221;


  * when someone asks you how you solved something, don't just say &#8220;good communication is important&#8221;. Everyone says that! ELABORATE! we want to know how you communicated!


  * when the interviewer can't think of anything to say, help us out! Sometimes, we're just confused. =)


  * You have to stand out from everyone else. Canned answers just won't do it.


  * confidence and enthusiasm are key; even if you're not the most qualified, your enthusiasm will be (mis?)interpreted as an extension of your willingness to learn.
</ul> 

I'm sure there are more things, and I'll add to this later, but this is all I can come up with at this late hour. =)
  
  
Hopefully, that'll help you in your interviews!

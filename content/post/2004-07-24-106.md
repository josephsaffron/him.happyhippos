Today was an absolutely gorgeous day! 23 degrees, sun shining brightly, nice and breezy; what more could I ask for? except that I woke up at 2:30 pm, cause I'm an idiot. Anyway, played tennis today from 4 pm till 6 pm, came home. Then I saw the open swimming pool and did a few laps in it. Yes, I swam in the westcourt swimming pool. Water clarity was a bit lacking, and there were bits and pieces of things lying around, but there was nothing living in the pool, thank goodness. Came back dripping wet and cold, and almost step on three earwigs (nasty little creatures!) Then shower and make food. I'm eating some chicken-mushroom soup pasta as I'm writing this. Pretty good day; except I didn't DO anything. Not good; exams are soon (two weeks) and I haven't started studying yet. Hopefully I'll be able to get some of that done later. =)

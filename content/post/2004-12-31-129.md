I just got up from a 2 hour nap from 4-6 pm; I had the radio playing in the background, and my dreams went haywire. I dreamed about everything from a new, renovated seagram that looked more like a penthouse than anything else, a huge oil refinery that I had to climb, a helpless drug addict that my pastor invited to church, a building project that I had to complete; bizzare. In that zone of almost-asleep, almost-awake, your mind is super sensitive. I imagine that's what being drunk feels kinda like. In such a state, you don't really know what you're doing; and you can say or see things that you didn't intend to. =p Gotta be careful.

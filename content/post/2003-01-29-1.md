Alright, I've just discovered that I have carpal tunnel syndrome.. Yay! =P I checked the symptoms, and I have ALL of them; numbness, pain, and difficulty grasping objects. So now I installed a program called Break Reminder that will force me to take a 20 second break every 10 minutes. It's a pretty robust program, and I'm quite enchanted with it. =) I think I'll install it at work. Anyhow, it's time for lunch!

On Monday, my cell group (minus Bonny) made easter eggs at my house! =) It was immensely fun, especially with the egg blowing and dyeing. My mom made &#8220;dun dan&#8221; (egg custard) with the remains of the egg, even though Leona had some saliva in her egg bowl. =p Ah well, boiling kills everything, right? hehehe.. Photos will be posted soon! Speaking of photos, my tungsten is due to arrive sometime today. However, I managed to get a camera (Canon s230) for the same price! Now my dilemma is this: Which one to keep? The tungsten will be more useful, but will sell for more; the s230 is just nice, and can record videos with sound! What to do? =( To make matters worse, I saw a posting in the tor.forsale newsgroup selling my laptop (or equivalent) with MUCH fewer features for $2000 CDN! So I could sell off EVERYTHING and get a nice new laptop; Too many decisions! nooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!

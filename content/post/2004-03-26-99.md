I was reading some fantasy today, and I picked up the new Robert Jordan hardcover for 40% off, thanks to Sarah's iRewards card. =) Anyway, I was just thinking about the reading I was doing and the way the character's voices sound in my head. A lot of the time, they sound like various people I know, who have similar characters. Apparently, hearing voices in your head makes your reading slower (actually, it's also a sign of impending lunacy) but I feel that it adds to the effect. Otherwise, the characters are all monotone and boring. I also noticed that when I read the words of other people, I hear their inflections and tones in my head. I guess it's sort of like placing their words in context. Some people sound nothing like themselves when they write though, and that messes me up. Quick survey guys:

1) Do you hear people's voices when you read?
  
  
2) Do you write like you talk?

I'm not sure about my answer to number 2, so I guess I can ask a third question:

3) Do I write like I talk?

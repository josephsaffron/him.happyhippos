Yesterday, I was treated to an evening at the [Vancouver Aquarium](http://vanaqua.org), where they had set up tables of food around near each station. As you stood in line waiting for food, you could look at all the different sea creatures around. I must say that I was impressed by this attraction. There were so many interesting things to look at, and there was a live band playing, causing many of the conference attendees to spontaneously dance!

I really had a great time, and I even got to watch part of the total lunar eclipse! If you're in town, definitely drop by the Vancouver aquarium, and check out [Stanley Park](http://www.seestanleypark.com/) while you're there, it is a sight to see.

As I was walking through the Vancouver Aquarium today, I saw a catch phrase that pretty much summarises my entire experience in Vancouver. Over and over, with each new sight that amazed me, I had this feeling which I couldn't really describe. This phrase encapsulates not only everything that amazed me here, but everything that has ever caused my heart to skip a beat, or my breath to catch in my throat. _Beauty by Design._ All of the animals, all of the trees and flowers, even the very stones of the earth. Because they were all designed so perfectly, they are all beautiful. From the most simple structure on the planet, made of a single atom, to the mighty mountains that form the backbone of the earth, each part radiates its own form of beauty, marked by the hand of the One who created them.

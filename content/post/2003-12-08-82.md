As some of you know, I got a new [axim](http://www1.us.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/axim_x3i?c=us&#038;cs=555&#038;l=en&#038;s=biz) a few days ago;. It's a wonderful toy, and I've been having a lot of fun with it. It's equipped w/ 802.11b (wireless) meaning I can use icq/msn at school! I'm currently making this post on my axim from MC!

Anyway, I've been really busy w/ studying lately, so nothing too eventful. My laptop broke again, though, so I sent an email to Michael Dell. Don't know if he got it, but whatever !

Ok, I should get back too learning more about OS!

Oh, I forgot to mention, I used this thing like a book, and read eBook versions of Harry Potter yesterday, finished both in 8 hours!

final week of work; only 5 days remaining. A sense of finality is in the air. Everything is completed. Work reports, outstanding projects, it's all done. I even cleaned up my desk! I'm just waiting for it all to finish, so I can go back to school.
  
  
Worship on Sunday went fairly well, despite losing three core members, but Vic came in as a last minute replacement, saving the day! And Holz mad piano skillz also saved the day! =) I was so glad to be able to serve on the worship team with them; but I think that these past two weekends have tired me out totally, and I will have to take a break;. a LONG break. I mean, I am totally exhausted. And I still have to take part in a short drama for an event at our church on Friday. Still working out the details of presentation, but I think it will be cool. =) Plus, going to see X2 afterwards! Yay!
  
  
Tonite our TCG will be meeting for the last time, and we're going out for dinner. We'll also review what we learned and stuff, it'll be fun. =D

This morning, I went to a church down the street from where I'm staying in San Diego, expecting a Christian church service. Instead, I was shown a mixture of new-age and wiccan philosophies, with the primary theme being that we are all able to do whatever we want, because we are god. Symbols of butterflies and suns were present all through the service. The most disturbing thing was that some of the quotes they used were from the bible or christian sources, but slightly twisted.. For instance, &#8220;You are my beloveds, with whom I am well pleased&#8221; was used to exhort the congregation. Also, the reverend talked about how we are all christs. They even sang a song by nicole nordeman.. &#8220;I Am&#8221;, in the album &#8220;Woven and Spun&#8221;, except some of the words were changed around. I wasn't sure whether to leave as soon as I figured this out, or just sit and listen through the whole thing. The scariest thing was the lady who led meditations.. throughout the whole service, she just sat there with her eyes closed, smiling.. she almost seemed intoxicated, at times. Quite an experience, not one that I'd care to repeat anytime soon. Disturbing on many levels.

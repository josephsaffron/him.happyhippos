Couple updates: I have advance screening tickets to the Matrix Reloaded! 10:15 pm tonite, and I'm going with a bunch of friends. We're going early to get good seats. hopefully it won't be too full! Secondly, I found a social dance partner! woooooo!
  
  
I'll be taking beginner again, since my partner isn't too keen on taking intermediate or advanced. =)
  
  
Anyhow, it's time for STATS! YAY!

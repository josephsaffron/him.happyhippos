'twas the night before Christmas and up in the air
  
  
flew a little blue man draped in silky black hair
  
  
He spouted his wisdom, and told all his jokes
  
  
But he did this in silence, lest he wake other folk

His tired companion curled up in her seat
  
  
Dreams of snow-covered hills, a wonderful treat!
  
  
As they both closed their eyes, a well deserved rest
  
  
A loud voice they heard, shouting with zest

&#8220;Are you hungry? You're rotten!&#8221; they heard the voice shout
  
  
And maniac laughter echoed about
  
  
&#8220;Aloha! Ohana!&#8221; said our little blue man
  
  
as they looked out the window, the the skies did they scan

And what did they see but a giant red sleigh
  
  
With a jolly old elf, his beard in disarray
  
  
&#8220;Merry Christmas!&#8221; he shouted, as he turned a hard right
  
  
&#8220;Go to sleep my dear Stitch, and have a safe flight!&#8221;

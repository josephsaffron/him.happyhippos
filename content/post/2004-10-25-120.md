_Restaurant_ - VCEC (Conference Location)
  
  
_Type_ - Breakfast
  
  
_Meal_ - Continental Breakfast (free)

Good croissants, but orange juice in wineglasses? Weird.

_Restaurant_ - Kareiko Japanese (Burrard St, Vancouver)
  
  
_Type_ - Lunch
  
  
_Meal_ - Bento ($14.50)

Excellent sashimi! A bit on the pricey side, but definitely upper class atmosphere. The only Japanese restaurant that I've ever been to where the waiters/chefs all spoke Japanese exclusively to each other. This was quite possibly the most stylish bento I've ever had. The salmon was sliced in a sort of cloud shaped manner, and the texture was very good, better than anything back in Toronto. If you can afford it, go for it.

_Restaurant_ - VCEC (Welcome Reception)

Hard to describe. Since pictures _are_ worth a thousand words though;.

That can't be healthy;. I just filled up on a combination of clams, mussels, sushi, and shrimp.

I can talk in whale too. =) If you haven't watched the movie, you won't get the joke, and all I can say is &#8220;Go watch it!&#8221; It was the best movie I've seen this whole term! Dory was so good, and the turtles were hilarious! The whale part just killed me;. I was slapping my knee, and all. =) I couldn't stop laughing during the funny parts, and the heart-wrenching parts brought a tear to my eye (well, not literally). What I'm trying to say is, this movie is a wild emotional ride, at least for me. Then again, my emotions are easily manipulated, and I frequently get sucked into movies, caring for characters and whatnot. There's always that stupid heart twinge whenever something sad happens, but it is blockable. I have to manually do it though, and usually my guard is down during movies. If you're watching a movie with me, don't look at my eyes. =p Anyways, I think I've written way more than necessary about myself, and I really should be paying attention to my class. =)
